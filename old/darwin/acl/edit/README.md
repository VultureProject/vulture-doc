---

An ACL lets you define custom rules for blocking malicious requests.


On the **condition** tab, you will be able to configure an advanced **Access Control List**.

Here you don't define the action of the ACL. This is just a single rule not applied. To apply it you will need to create a **[WORKFLOW](/workflow)**
