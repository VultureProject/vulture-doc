# WAF Policies
Vulture integrates filtering engines to prevent threats like **injections**, **cross site scripting** and **OWASP Top10** threats.  
This filtering is directly integrated in the firewall workflows of Vulture 4 to efficiently block dangerous or undesired behaviours.  

On this page, you'll be able to define your filtering policies, decide which protections to activate and which Ruleset(s) to assign.  
These policies will then be available for you to use in your **[Workflows](/workflow/)** to be protected, and can be tailored to your website(s) need(s) through the use of Rulesets (for this, go to **[WAF Rulesets](/darwin/defender_ruleset)** to create and assign one to your policy).
