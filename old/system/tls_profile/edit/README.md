# TLS Profiles

Whenever you want use TLS in vulture configuration, you will need a "TLS profile".
TLS configuration may be use in TCP & HTTP listeners and in HTTP backend.

## Friendly Name

This is the friendly name of the TLS Profile. Vulture will use this name to refer to the TLS Profile wherever in the Web GUI.

## Certificate

This is the friendly name of the X509 certificate that will be presented when using this TLS profile

## Browsers compatibility

To avoid the pain of selecting complex ciphersuite string, Vulture has packaged ready-to-use TLS ciphers list.

* Advanced (A score): This is the best choice for security, only TLSv1.3 and TLSv1.2 are allowed, with strong ciphers
* Broad Compatibility (B score): Same as Advanced, only TLSv1.3 and TLSv1.2 are allowed but allowing the use of less secure ciphers 
* Widest Compatibility (C score): TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3 with medium ciphers
* Legacy (D score): TLSv1.0, TLSv1.1, TLSv1.2, TLSv1.3 with low ciphers
* Custom: Here you may choose custom TLS protocols and cipher suite

## Advertise protocol list

This allows to configure the HAPROXY TLS ALPN extension and advertises the specified protocol list as supported on top of ALPN. The protocol list consists in a list of protocol names, for instance: *HTTP1.1 HTTP1.0*. ALPN is required to enable HTTP/2 on an HTTP frontend.

If both HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1 are expected to be supported, both versions can be advertised, in order of
preference, like below : *HTTP2 HTTP1.1*

## Verify client certificate

When the TLS profile is associated to a TCP/HTTP listener, you may enforce the client to present a valid, trusted, X509 certificate. If verify client is set to "required": the client MUST present a valid/trusted certificate. If verify client is set to "optional": the client MAY present a valid/trusted certificate.

If set to "no": No client certificate are expected / prompted by Vulture.

## Client CA

Whenever the verify client is set to "optional" or "required", you have to select here the *X509 CA Certificate* that should be trusted.
