# Users' Scopes

From this menu you can declare policy to manage claims returned by external OpenId Providers. 

`Name` is a unique friandly name that refers to the scope configuration

You can click on "Add an entry" to add rules that will alter claims returned by your OpenID Provider. Using a WISIWIG interface you can add `IF` condition on existing claims and `THEN` trigger actions to set or append values to the user's scope.
