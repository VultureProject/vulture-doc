# TOTP - Time-based OTP Profiles

From this page you can manage TOTP profiles registered into Vulture. These profiles correspond to the registration of users into the Vulture Portal when an MFA configuration has been set up using the **Time-based OTP Authentication type**

- See [MFA / TOTP](mfa.md) to configure an MFA profile using TOTP
- See [Portal settings](../portal/portal/#otp) to enable MFA/TOTP settings in an authentication portal

From the list of stored TOTP profile, the only available action is "delete" : You may want to delete a stored profile whenever the user has been deleted from your authentication repository or when the user has lost/changed its OTP device.
